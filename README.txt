"Minimum Wage Increases Kill Jobs"... “Anyone can get rich through investing”..., Quotes like this, one liner distillations of years of supposed experience and research, are often spread like wildfire both interpersonally and over traditional and new media. These pieces of “advice” about wealth and poverty influence everything from individual financial choices to large-scale voting patterns and thus policy decisions. We believe that much of this messaging is both spread by those already in power, that the claims are based on data analysis that is dubious at best, and that they serve to mislead and keep existing power structures in place.

We aim to create an data-driven accessible interactive pamphlet that first builds our argument against these types of financial proverbs, then analyzes and disproves a select few proverbs, and to finally argue that this kind of messaging ultimately harms financially vulnerable populations. All of these claims will be accompanied by easy-to-digest data that is transparently cleaned and analyzed.
